### Step one

If you want to register a domain name that is used the world over. Go to https://namecheap.com. If you want to register a domain specific to your country, head over to a domain name registery in your country. Simply Google "domains" if you don't know of one. There will be some international registeries, but there should also be some local ones. Please check for the TLD that represents your country and go to that website.

At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution.
