#### Now about me, and whatt4. 

I am not a technically savvy person. In the sense that I do not have any programming experience. My computer experience is using apps and software that other people build. 

About September of 2021 I decided that after all these years of dreaming about having my own website, I was finally going to have one. 

I was pumped and ready to go. I Googled "how to build a website for begginers. 

##### There were so many results for this, I thought it was going to be straight forward!

The process is. 

Avoiding the marketing pit of doom!🔥🕳️🔥 Not so easy!

So after wading through months of reading and many trial and errors.

I have put together a few guides. 🦄Free of marketing clutter🦄 To help you build a blog or webiste and get yourself online. 

###### There will be no affiliate links in the articles or the projects.
Beacuse there is no need to use the paid versions of the apps I recommend. Until the time comes that you need to increase their functionality and reach. 

###### Of course if you want to purchase the product. Please do. 
###### Then please use our affiliate links that are all on the Tools page.
